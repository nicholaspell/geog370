<h2>Nicholas Pell</h2>
<h3>The map I constructed displays what percent of each states total energy consumption comes from their transportation sector. The data is separated into five quantiles with an equal number of states in each. The idea behind choosing this map was to see which states should be prioritizing and promoting alternative transportation methods that would lower energy consumption.</h3>
