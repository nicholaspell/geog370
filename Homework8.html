<h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
<h2>Nicholas Pell</h2>
<h3>The question I looked to answer was, "How many Night Clubs in D.C. have a Metro Bus Stop within a reasonably walkable distance?" I decided to define a "walkable distance" as a 0.5 mile. To answer the question I created a buffer with a 0.5 mile radius around all of the night clubs in D.C.. Then I used the intersection tool to show which of the Metro Bus Stops were within that 0.5 mile radius. The map shows that every night club in D.C. has a Metro Bus Stop within a 0.5 mile radius of the club.</h3>
